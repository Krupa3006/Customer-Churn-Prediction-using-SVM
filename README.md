# Customer-Churn-Prediction-using-SVM
Customer attrition, or churn, is when customers stop doing business with a company. It can have a significant impact on a company's revenue, and it's crucial for businesses to find out the reasons why customers are leaving and take steps to reduce the number of customers leaving. One way to do this is by identifying customer segments that are at risk of leaving and implementing retention strategies to keep them. By using data and machine learning techniques, companies can predict which customers are likely to leave in the future and take actions to keep them before they decide to leave.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to build a model for predicting customer churn using Support Vector Machines (SVM) on the Telco Customer Churn dataset. SVM is a powerful algorithm for classification tasks, and we will leverage its capabilities to predict customer churn based on various features in the dataset.

## Dataset
The [Telco Customer Churn dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn) contains information about customers such as their gender, age, tenure, services they have subscribed to, contract length, monthly charges, total charges, and whether they have churned or not.

## Methodology
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables.
- Exploratory Data Analysis: Understanding the data through visualizations and statistical summaries.
- Feature Engineering: Creating new features or transforming existing features to improve model performance.
- Model Building: Training and evaluating SVM models to predict customer churn.
- Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the SVM models and selecting the best one based on evaluation metrics.
- Model Deployment: Deploying the selected SVM model to make predictions on new data.
## Technologies Used
- Python
- pandas
- NumPy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn (for SVM implementation)
## Conclusion
By using Support Vector Machines (SVM) for predicting customer churn, companies can build a robust model that can effectively identify at-risk customers and take proactive measures to retain them, ultimately improving customer satisfaction and reducing revenue loss.
